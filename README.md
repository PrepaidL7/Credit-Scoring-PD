# Credit Risk Modeling Portfolio

This repository showcases a series of end-to-end credit risk projects that I developed. 
It’s structured to demonstrate both my practical skills and theoretical understanding—and to complement my existing **Credit-Classification-Models** codebase by adding deeper regulatory and scorecard components.

## What You’ll Find Here

- **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**  
  • Imputation of missing values, handling of imbalanced classes, and strategic binning of categorical variables  
  • Custom scripts for exploratory data analysis and variable selection

- **Regulatory Transformations**  
  • Weight of Evidence (WoE) and Information Value (IV) calculations  
  • Fine/coarse classing workflows to prepare variables for scoring models

- **Probability of Default (PD) Modeling**  
  • Step-by-step logistic regression pipelines with feature diagnostics  
  • Comparison against Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers  
  • Performance reporting (AUC, KS statistic, confusion matrix)
